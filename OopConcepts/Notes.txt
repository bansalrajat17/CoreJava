== operator - Reference Comparison If both references are pointing to same object.
Equals method - Equals method meant for reference comparison but in case of string it is meant
for content comparison. 

Object Creation in SCP and Heap -:

1 - For every string literal object will be created in SCP.
2 - For every new operator object will be created in the heap.
3 - For runtime operation object will be created in the heap.

Covariant Return Type - Method Overriding is possible by changing return type.
